    <h2>Why Babylon is my favorite bedwars map</h2>
    <p><strong>Babylon</strong> is very well-designed map in terms of build quality. Personally, there is nostalgic value to it, and I really like the <span style="color:aqua">color schemes</span> and designs. My friend also prestiged on Babylon.</p>
    <p>Strategically speaking:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It is a large map, so you won't get immediately rushed after taking out the adjacent base.</li>
        <li>It is fast iron.</li>
        <li>Everyone who queues it is bad.</li>
        <li>There is a random, useless island, so you can predict if players are incompetent if they bridge there.</li>
        <li>It's big easy to clutch.</li>
    </ul>
